<p>This script identifies a reference zone for the travel cost index and related measures and computes the reference market place attractions.</p>
<p>The reference zone is identified as the TAZ that has the most attractions within it's market area. The log sums of the JEMnR access utilities are used to identify market areas. These measure the composite cost of travel between zones and are calculated in JEMnR for each trip purpose and income group. The reference zone is identified as the zone that has greatest market attractions, subject to limits of transit availability and presence of households. Attraction scores are calculated by dividing the market attractions for each zone by the maximum market attractions for all zones. This is done for each trip purpose and income group. The results are summed for each zone to get a total score. Since there are three income groups and four trip purposes, the maximum score is 12. Reference market baskets are calculated for each combination of income and trip purpose. Market baskets are calculated for each TAZ by calculating the percentage of trip attractions to each TAZ and placing this vector of values in order of descending log sums. Then a cumulative sum of the percentages is calculated and the zones whoses values add to 50% are identified. This is the market area for the TAZ. The market basket for the TAZ is calculated by summing the size terms from the destination choice model for TAZs in the market area. The reference market basket is calculated as the mean of the market baskets for all zones.</p>

<p>This function is applied to each TAZ by trip purpose and income group the steps are:
*   Calculate the percent of trips going to each zone
*   Order the percent of trips by the order of the log sums
*   Calculate the cumulative sums of the percents
*   Identify the zones that sum to 50%
*   Sum the size terms for those zones to get values for calculating the market basket
*   Identify zones that have a log sum of one or greater
*   Sum the size terms in those zones to get values for calculation reference zone scores
